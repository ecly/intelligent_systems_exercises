a) One branch on the left branch (marked with [WRONG BRANCH]) I accidentally played
   the same move in both branches, causing that side to get a wrong score.
   Its score should be the same as the right branch of 0.375.

   I hope you will bear with me as it was rather cumbersome to draw.
   Any good recommendations for software to do this both prettier
   and perhaps even faster?

b) Minimax chooses to play the middle branch, which is to lay the coin down in the
   lower left corner. This branch has a minimax value of 0.75, whereas the other two
   branches have values of 0.375.
